## 📊 Architecture Overview

### State Management
```
Redux Store (Clean Architecture)
├── canvas (shapes, viewport, tools, selection)
├── user (authentication, profile)
├── presence (cursors, online users, activity)
└── websocket (connection status, latency)

Note: Legacy firstSlice and secondSlice removed for cleaner architecture
```

### Component Hierarchy
```
App
├── LoginScreen (if not authenticated)
└── CanvasScreen (if authenticated)
    ├── Canvas
    │   └── CanvasRenderer
    │       └── Shapes (Rectangle, Circle, Text)
    ├── CursorsLayer
    │   └── UserCursor (for each online user)
    ├── PresencePanel
    │   └── UserPresence (for each online user)
    └── Toolbar
        ├── ShapeSelector
        ├── ColorPicker
        └── CanvasControls
```

### Services Layer
```
Services
├── WebSocketService (connection management)
├── CanvasEngine (shape operations)
└── CollisionDetection (hit testing)
```
