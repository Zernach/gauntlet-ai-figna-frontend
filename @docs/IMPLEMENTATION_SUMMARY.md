6. **canvas_versions** - Snapshots for history/recovery
7. **canvas_collaborators** - Sharing and permissions
8. **canvas_comments** - Comments (optional feature)
9. **canvas_activity** - Audit trail

### Key Relationships
- Users own canvases (1:many)
- Canvases contain objects (1:many)
- Users create objects (1:many)
- Users have presence records (1:many)
- Canvases have versions (1:many)
- Canvases have collaborators (many:many)

### Performance Optimizations
- 20+ strategic indexes for fast queries
- JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- TTL-based cleanup for ephemeral presence data
- Composite indexes for common query patterns

## 🌐 API Architecture

### HTTP Endpoints (`/api/gauntlet/...`)
**Purpose:** Authentication, canvas metadata, read-only data access

**Characteristics:**
- RESTful design for read operations and metadata
- JWT authentication
- Request/response validation
- Rate limiting
- Caching with ETags
- Used for: Auth, canvas list/create, history, suggestions

### WebSocket Endpoints (`/ws/gauntlet/...`)
**Purpose:** Real-time collaboration, shape operations, AI commands, presence

**Characteristics:**
- **Primary data path** for all real-time operations
- Persistent connections per canvas
- Binary message support for large data
- Heartbeat mechanism (30s TTL)
- Automatic reconnection with state recovery
- Message batching for performance
- Message prioritization (AI > shapes > cursor)
- Used for: Shape create/update/delete, AI commands, cursor tracking, presence

### Message Flow (WebSocket-First Architecture)
1. **User Action** → Redux Dispatch
2. **Redux Middleware** → WebSocket Service
3. **WebSocket** → Backend Server (with optimistic UI update)
4. **AI/Shape Processing** → Execute operation
5. **Database Update** → Persist changes
6. **Broadcast** → All connected users
7. **Redux Update** → Re-render UI (confirm optimistic update)
