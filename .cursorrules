Never run deployment commands without explicit user approval.
This includes: deploy, push, publish, release, netlify deploy, railway up, git push, npm publish, yarn deploy.

Always ask before:
- Running any deployment or publishing commands
- Making network requests that modify production systems
- Running commands with --prod or --production flags
- Pushing to git repositories
- Deploying to hosting services

Important:
- Always use useMemo, useCallback, etc.
